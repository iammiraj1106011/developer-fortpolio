            <h3>Web Developer</h3>
            <p>I’m a web developer. I spend my whole day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript;
                dabbling with Node.js and MangoDB; and inhaling a wide variety of potentially useless information
                through a
                few
                hundred RSS feeds. I build websites that delight and inform. I do it well.</p>

            <p>I’m curious, and I enjoy work that challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a different
                direction. I do my best to stay on top of changes in the state of the art so that I can meet challenges
                with tools well suited to the job at hand. The list of projects I follow on GitHub will give you a good
                idea of the types of tools I’d prefer to be using, and my Instapaper “Starred” list will give you a
                glimpse into the reading material I find interesting enough to share.</p>

                <p>A slight clarification of the above: I’m actually a philosophy student cleverly disguised as a
                    successful
                    web developer. Since it was relatively clear early on that it would be slightly more than difficult
                    to
                    make a living sitting under a tree while reading Kant, I’ve focused my energies on the web, which
                    happily has proven itself to be a wonderful decision.</p>
